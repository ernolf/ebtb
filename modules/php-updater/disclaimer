                            ==============

    Please note that use of this script is subject to the following terms and
    conditions. By using this script, you agree to these terms.

    Contribution Requirement:
    -------------------------
    I expect all users to contribute in some way, especially if the script is
    used for commercial or professional purposes.
    Information on how to contribute is provided at the end of this script or
    can be accessed by running:

        - $ME --contribute

    Data Collection and Use:
    ------------------------
    During execution, non-sensitive system data may be transferred. This data
    includes, but is not limited to:

        - Distribution information
        - Versions of various software components (especially PHP packages)
        - Configured APT sources
        - Installed and active web servers
        - User queries and responses
        - Error stack traces

    The script’s activity is logged for reference. You can view this log under:

        $(C)${F[log]}$(N)

    All collected data is used solely to optimize and improve the script. No
    additional information beyond what is contained in the logfiles will be
    analyzed.

    Anonymization:
    --------------
    Usernames recorded in logfiles are standardized to “root”, “sudo_user”,
    “www-data”, or “unprivileged_user” to ensure anonymity. Additionally, an
    anonymized fingerprint is generated for each computer using the machine ID.
    This fingerprint associates the data with a computer rather than with any
    individual. No statistical analysis or comparisons with previous data are
    performed.

    Disclaimer:
    -----------
    If you do not agree with these terms, please terminate the script
    immediately by pressing $(box q).
    Use of this script implies acceptance of these terms.
