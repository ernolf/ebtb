                            ==============

    Using this script is not for free!

    $(Cbg)     I expect everyone who uses this script to contribute in some way,     $(N)
    $(Cbg)     especially if you use it for commercial or professional purposes.     $(N)

    How you can contribute is shown at the end of this script or by running

        - $me --contribute

    Data from your system can be transferred, such as

        - distribution
        - versions of various php packages,
        - the configured apt-sources
        - installed and used web servers

    The script’s activity is logged for reference. You can view this log under:

        "/tmp/ebtb/logfiles/$me.log"

    An anonymized fingerprint is created for each computer using the machine ID
    associating the information with “a computer” but not with any individual.

    As the operator of a Nextcloud web server, you likely understand that IP
    addresses can reveal certain information. Your IP address will also be
    logged by the module server (itself a Nextcloud server), though this data
    is only used where technically essential.


    The data is used solely to optimize the script itself. During times when
    the script is not being actively developed, no data will be transmitted.

    Please end the script now if you do not agree with these terms or if your
    are not willing to contribute.
