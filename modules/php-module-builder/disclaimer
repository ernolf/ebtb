  Disclaimer
  ==========

  This script is intended for advanced administrators who are comfortable creating their own modules.
  It makes life a little easier. Although the build process is made more secure because tested, the
  possibility of shooting yourself in the feet isn't completely eliminated. It is recommended to use
  packaged extensions from your distribution wherever possible. You may need to add a PPA (Ubuntu) or
  DPA (Debian) to your Apt sources to increase the range of installable PHP candidates.
  Visit OndÅ™ej SurÃ½'s website: https://deb.sury.org/ for more details about that.

  Only if the desired extension then still is not offered as package, such as with the lua module, this
  script can (and should) be used.


  Good luck,
  ernolf
